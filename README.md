# Levyloota

A simple Rails app to demonstrate some Rails features. Bootstrap v5 is used improved styling.

## Description

The app is a simple CRUD app for managing a list of music artists, albums and tracks. It is a pretty pointless app since you could use Spotify's API to get this information rather than keeping own database.

## Disclaimers

- Code contains lots of unnecessary scaffolding so this is not a good example of how to write a Rails app.
- Normally you would use the `i18n.t` function to translate strings. However, this app is for demo purposes so no translations are used. This makes it easier for non-rails developers to understand the code.
